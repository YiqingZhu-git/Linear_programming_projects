Some of the artifacts include solving linear programming problems in Python using different libraries (SciPy, CvxPy, and Pyomo) 
and doing research on a topic covered in class, like NetworkX. The analysis of the route and the distance created by different 
optimization methods Traveling salesman problem, nearest neighbor method, and other starting points.
For a clear representation of the results, the portfolio also applies visualization tools such as choropleth and folium to show the 
result in an appreciative way.
